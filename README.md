During my project I just built off of what we did in exercise-20d.
What I changed:
- Finished adding the end scene by making it go back to the start.
- Changed the ship into something different.
- Changed the asteroids to what looks like metal boxes that the enemy ship is "protecting"
- Added a third "asteroid" and made it a satelite to give it a different look
- Made it so that the "asteroids" break into four smaller pieces instead of three
- Made the smaller "asteroids" different 
- Added a starry background to match the look of an Ateroids 2D shooter
- Changed the font a little bit on the start and end screen
- Changed the exhaust on the ship the player controls
- Enemy ship is also a different design
- Enemy ship seems to glow red to user
- Improved the speed on the enemy to make it a little trickier
- Added an audio source on the play screen

Overall:
Being able to work straight from exercise 20d made this a lot easier for me.
Unity has had me flustered and stuck at times but I enjoy the struggle a little because I am learning a new concept.
Also some of the nodes shown in the example videos would not work for me so I would have to put in a different node a few times, I don't know why but i figured it out in the end thankfully.
The example videos are super beneficial for a new unity learner like myself, being able to know whats going on and not just plugging in code has made the experience a lot easier.
